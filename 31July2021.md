## Problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/submissions/

# Problem desc:

Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The relative order of the elements may be changed.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

# Solution:

```
class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:
        i = 0
        arrLen = len(nums)
        while i < arrLen:
            if (nums[i] == val):
                nums.pop(i)
                arrLen -= 1
            else:
                i += 1
```
